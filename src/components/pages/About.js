      <p>
          After teaching math in the Chicago Public School system for 7 years, I discovered a love and aptitude for coding languages, specifically the logic of the back-end.  After researching assorted avenues for learning, I 
          applied and was accepted to Northwestern University’s coding boot-camp, put on by Trilogy.  For 6 months, I taught during the day and coded at night, learning every language and concept put in front of me.  
          I’m a dedicated worker, a quick learner, and ready to add my experience and expertise to any team I work on.
