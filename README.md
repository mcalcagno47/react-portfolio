# React Portfolio

## Description
This application is meant to demonstrate knowledge of REACT, along with the added objective of showcasing my work to interested parties.  It includes an About Me section, my resume, my portfolio and a page that allows users to contact me.  I also added buttons to the bottom of the page allowing users to see my github and linkedin profiles.

## Installation
Once the github has been cloned, the following technologies are required using 'npm install':
- express
- nodemon
- react
- nodemailer
- gh-pages
- bootstrap
- axios

Writing, 'npm i' in your console will install all of these technologies.


## Usage
When someone follows the link to the site, they are shown the About Me page.  Using the nav-bars in the header allows the user to quickly switch to one of the other three pages: my resume, my portfolio and a contact me page.  The resume section has a link that allows the user to print the resume as a pdf.  The portfolio images all link to my applications.  The contact me section allows easy access to my email address, allowing users to ask me questions directly.  Links in the footer also redirect the user to my github and linked in profiles.  The final button allows users to contact me using gmail.
